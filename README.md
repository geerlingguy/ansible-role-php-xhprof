# Ansible Role: PHP-XHProf

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-php-xhprof.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/ansible-role-php-xhprof)

Installs PHP [XHProf](http://php.net/manual/en/book.xhprof.php) on Linux servers.

> **Note**: The XHProf extension has been on life support since Facebook abandoned active development around 2015. There is a better-maintained fork that works on the latest PHP versions called Tideways, and there's an Ansible role for itâ€”please check out [`geerlingguy.php-tideways`](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-php-tideways) if you need to support PHP versions later than 7.0.

## Requirements

None.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    workspace: /root

Where XHProf setup files will be downloaded and built.

    xhprof_download_url: https://github.com/RustJason/xhprof/archive/php7.zip
    xhprof_download_folder_name: xhprof-php7

The URL from which XHProf will be downloaded. Note that this default is for the PHP 7-compatible version of XHProf. If you're using PHP 5.x, you should probably switch to the 'official' upstream source: `https://github.com/phacility/xhprof/archive/master.tar.gz`.

    xhprof_output_dir: /tmp

Directory where XHProf runs are stored.

    php_xhprof_lib_dir: /usr/share/php/xhprof_lib
